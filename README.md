# JARMS

AI-Assisted Emergency Audio Triage System

JARMS enhances Personal Alert Button (PAB) emergency systems used by elderly residents living alone.  
The system analyzes audio alerts using multiple AI agents and converts them into structured emergency insights to support responders.

# The Challenge

## Problem Statement

How might we use AI to enhance the PAB system so that hotline responders can more accurately understand the senior's situation, assess urgency, and allocate resources effectively?

4 key notes:
| Key Design Principles | Why It Matters                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed                 | Every second wasted not allocating resources could be severe                                       |
| Accuracy              | Responders need accurate context and situation assessment, not just an alert signal                |
| Resource Allocation   | The right help must reach the right person at the right time                                       |
| Prioritisation        | Not all cases are equal, the system must rank urgency to prevent critical cases from being delayed |

PAB systems typically provide very limited context.

Responders receive:

- a button trigger
- a short audio recording

However emergency audio often contains:

| Challenge           | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Noise               | Background sounds obscure speech                               |
| Multilingual speech | Residents may speak dialects such as Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay |
| Incomplete speech   | Residents may be unable to clearly describe symptoms           |
| Non-verbal distress | Breathing problems or falls may occur without speech           |
| Code Switch         | Using multiple languages in 1 sentence (Hokkien and English)   |

These issues slow emergency response decision making.

# SCDF Context

Singapore emergency response workflows commonly follow **SCDF urgency triage categories**.

JARMS aligns with this framework and introduces one additional safety category.

| JARMS Priority   | SCDF Alignment  | Meaning                    |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| life_threatening | Highest acuity  | Immediate danger to life   |
| emergency        | High acuity     | Serious urgent case        |
| requires_review  | JARMS extension | Ambiguous audio signals    |
| minor_emergency  | Lower urgency   | Medical attention required |
| non_emergency    | Low urgency     | Stable situation           |

The `requires_review` category ensures unclear signals are escalated for human evaluation.

# System Overview

JARMS processes audio using **parallel AI agents** and a **central triage engine**.

![Parallel Agents Architecture](docs/diagrams/parallel-agents.png)

Each agent analyzes a different aspect of the audio signal.

Their outputs converge into a **triage intelligence engine** that generates the final emergency assessment.

# Under the Hood Architecture

![Full System Architecture](docs/diagrams/system-architecture.png)

---

# Parallel AI Agents

The moment a PAB alert triggers, all AI agents start simultaneously.

This avoids sequential model bottlenecks and reduces response latency.

![Three AI Agents](docs/diagrams/ai-agents.png)

| Agent                      | Old Name               | Function                             | Example Signals             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Speech Intelligence        | Speech Transcriber     | Speech transcription and translation | spoken symptoms             |
| Situational Audio Analysis | General Audio Analyser | Emotional and distress detection     | crying, panic               |
| Acoustic Event Detection   | Targeted Audio Scanner | Medical signal detection             | breathing difficulty, falls |

---

# Triage Intelligence Engine

Once all agents complete analysis, their outputs are merged by the **Triage Agent**.

![Triage Agent Output](docs/diagrams/triage-output.png)

The engine generates three outputs.

| Output                  | Description                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Urgency Categorization  | Severity classification           |
| Situation Summary       | AI explanation of detected events |
| Resource Recommendation | Suggested responder action        |

# Impact of JARMS

| Metric                                    | Result      |

| Responder cognitive load                  | Reduced     |
| Average processing time                   | ~20 seconds |

# Database Schema (Core Tables)

The backend currently relies on the following core Supabase tables.

## `cases`

Primary operational table storing each alert/case lifecycle.

Key fields used by backend/frontend:

- `case_id` (string UUID)
- `nric` (beneficiary link)
- `button_id`
- `status` (`processing`, `new`, `claimed`, `dispatched`, `resolved`, plus WIP nurse-bot statuses)
- `urgency_bucket` (`life_threatening`, `emergency`, `requires_review`, `minor_emergency`, `non_emergency`)
- `queue_score` (numeric)
- `source` (for current flow, typically `pab_audio`)
- `transcript_raw`, `transcript_english`
- `audio_caption_text`
- `triage_flags` (array)
- `recommended_actions` (array)
- `sbar_json` (json)
- `audio_file_url`, `audio_duration_seconds`, `audio_uploaded_at`
- `opened_at`, `closed_at`, `updated_at`
- `assigned_operator_id`

## `pab_beneficiaries`

Resident profile and context used by triage and UI.

Frequently consumed fields:

- `nric`, `full_name`, `button_id`
- `primary_language`, `secondary_language`
- `address`, `unit_number`
- `phone_number`
- `emergency_contact_name`, `emergency_contact`
- `patient_medical_summary`
- optional medical/operational context: `dnr_status`, `consent_private_ambulance`, etc.

## `operators`

Operator identity used for login/session and assignment.

Commonly used fields:

- `operator_id`
- `username`
- `role`

---

# JSON Schemas (Data Contracts)

These are practical data contracts used between client, backend, and database mapping.

## 1) Audio Ingestion Request (`POST /cases/audio`)

Content type: `multipart/form-data`

```json
{
  "button_id": "PAB-001",
  "audio": "<binary audio file>"
}
```

## 2) Audio Ingestion Response (simplified)

```json
{
  "message": "Audio uploaded and case created",
  "case": {
    "case_id": "uuid",
    "status": "processing",
    "urgency_bucket": "requires_review",
    "queue_score": 0
  },
  "beneficiary": {
    "nric": "S1234567A",
    "full_name": "Resident Name",
    "primary_language": "english"
  },
  "triage_pipeline_result": {},
  "triage_pipeline_error": null
}
```

## 3) Cases List Response (`GET /cases/`)

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "case_id": "uuid",
      "status": "new",
      "urgency_bucket": "emergency",
      "queue_score": 82,
      "sbar_json": {
        "situation": "...",
        "background": "...",
        "assessment": "..."
      },
      "triage_flags": ["gasping_or_laboured_breathing"],
      "recommended_actions": ["call_995"],
      "full_name": "Resident Name",
      "address": "...",
      "unit_number": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4) Frontend-Internal Normalized Alert Shape (`mapCase`)

```json
{
  "id": "case_id",
  "tier": "urgency_bucket",
  "actionState": "status",
  "queue_score": 82,
  "location": "Address Unit",
  "button_location": "Living Room",
  "transcript": "transcript_english",
  "audio_caption_text": "...",
  "triage_flags": ["..."],
  "recommended_actions": ["..."],
  "sbar": {
    "situation": "...",
    "background": "...",
    "assessment": "..."
  },
  "beneficiary": {
    "nric": "...",
    "full_name": "...",
    "phone_number": "..."
  }
}
```

## 5) Realtime Trigger Event (Supabase `cases` table)

```json
{
  "event": "INSERT | UPDATE",
  "schema": "public",
  "table": "cases"
}
```

On each event, frontend re-fetches `GET /cases/` as source of truth.
